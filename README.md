# GAMER QUIZ
 Quiz for Gamers
Daniel Amadril JavaScript API Project

## API QUIZ
Creating a quiz with multiple choice questions, a timer and much more.

## Description
This project is simply for acedemic purposes. Creating a quiz through javascript and really understanding the use of API. I created a timed system that gives you a certain amount of time to answer the question, as well as color indicators if you got them wrong or right. I spent a lot of time trying to confiugure the local storage situation. Unfortuantely as of now, the only thing that does not work is saving the data into localstorage.
